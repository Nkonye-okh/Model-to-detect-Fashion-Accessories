# Model-to-detect-Fashion-Accessories
Detects Fashion Accessories via Convolutional Neural Networks

For this project I used the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist'>Fashion-MNIST</a> dataset, also available through <a href='https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html'><tt><strong>torchvision</strong></tt></a>. This dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes:
0. T-shirt/top
1. Trouser
2. Pullover
3. Dress
4. Coat
5. Sandal
6. Shirt
7. Sneaker
8. Bag
9. Ankle boot
